# cloth-simulation
Simple cloth simulation using particles and spring-dampers. 
Spring dampers connected between particles to keep them connected applying a spring/damper forcing during calculation.
Forward euler method is used to approximate the next position of each particle using basic netownian physics.
Gravity and aerodynamic forces are applied to each particle and a simple ground collision is implemented.
User controls allow cloth movement and wind speed adjustment.
